## Mini-Pascal Compiler

This is a compiler that takes any program written in a simplified version of the Pascal language called 'Mini-Pascal' and generates an executable assembly language file (.asm), while also providing feedback on any semantic or syntactical errors in your code.

This project is a way to explore the 6 steps that a compiler has to go through in order to make a program executable, and understanding in much more depth how does a computer can run a program written in a programming language. The 6 steps being lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation.

Due to Windows nature, we cannot execute the file directly using the Terminal, so in order to compensate this, the app generates an .asm file that later can be run using an x86 emulator such as DOSBox.

This project was made using C#, Visual Studio and .NET Framework.
